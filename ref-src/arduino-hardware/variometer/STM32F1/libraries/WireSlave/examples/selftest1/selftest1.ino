// Wire Slave Receiver
// by Nicholas Zambetti <http://www.zambetti.com>

// Demonstrates use of the Wire library
// Receives data as an I2C/TWI slave device
// Refer to the "Wire Master Writer" example for use with this

// Created 29 March 2006

// This example code is in the public domain.

// The code is temporarily moved to the code.cpp.
// This makes it possible to set breakpoints in eclipse IDE.
// I'm sure that there is an Eclipse configuration that makes it 
// possible for it to detect .ino files as .cpp, but I'm lazy
